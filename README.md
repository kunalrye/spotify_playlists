# Spotify Playlists
Looking at my music streaming history to try and find new music that I would like that is different from the suggestions that discover weekly and release radar provide.

## Notes so far:
Spotify genres seem to be only available by artist. This causes issues when songs are made by an artist that creates music across different genres or styles. For example, assume Mozart created a song that was classical rock. Now I really liked the song by Mozart but the style was classical rock. Now, when I start a song radio from that song, it will be populated with classical songs rather than classical rock songs.
